Git Flow Branching Model Sample
===============================

This is the sample implementation of the branching model described in here
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

The versioning scheme also follows the following specification:
http://semver.org/

Click the Network icon on the left to visualize how the branches are organized. 
Generally there should be two main branch:

- master
- develop

and other Supporting branches:

- feature
- release
- hotfixes

Please read the blog post for more detail on how to use those.
